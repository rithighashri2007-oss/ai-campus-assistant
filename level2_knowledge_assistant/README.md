In Level 2, the AI:

Reads your own documents
Searches inside them
Answers only from that data

This is how real campus / company AI assistants work.
================================================================================
>>>>>How Level 2 Works (Very Simple)

>You give the AI a text document
>The text is converted into numbers (embeddings)
>These numbers are stored in a vector database
> When a user asks a question:

&nbsp;	The question is also converted into numbers

&nbsp;	Similar numbers are searched

>AI uses the found text to answer
.......This method is called RAG.......
